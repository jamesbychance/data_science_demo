    "\n",

    "### Question 5: Econometrics => ML\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5**: What is the key difference between econometric methods and ML? How would economics and finance benefit from updating their statistical toolkit?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response**: \n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference lies in their fundamental approach to learning and complexity. Econometrics relies on multivariate linear regression, an 18th-century technology (already mastered by Gauss before 1794.) Standard econometric models do not learn - they require researchers to pre-specify relationships and assume linear functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, ML algorithms learn patterns in a high-dimensional space without being specifically directed. While humans are limited to understanding 3-dimensional relationships, an ML algorithm can spot patterns in a 100-dimensional world as easily as in our familiar 3-dimensional one.\n",
    "\n",
    "López de Prado uses a powerful analogy: just as medieval astronomers were limited by assuming only circular orbits (deemed \"holy\"), economists are constrained by assuming only linear relationships. He argues that \"what if economists finally started to consider non-linear functions? Where is our Kepler?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of updating the statistical toolkit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Theory development**: ML methods do not replace theory. They guide it\" by first identifying predictive patterns, then allowing researchers to build theoretical explanations\n",
    "2. **Practical necessity**: Econometrics may be good enough to succeed in financial academia (for now), but succeeding in business requires ML\n",
    "3. **Scientific progress**: López de Prado argues that econometrics is a primary reason economics and finance have not experienced meaningful progress over the past 70 years\n",
    "\n",
    "The core issue is not just non-linearity, but the fundamental inability of traditional econometric methods to learn and adapt versus ML's capacity for discovery and pattern recognition in complex, high-dimensional financial data.\n",

    "**Question 7**: You read a journal article that describes an investment strategy. In a backtest, it achieves an annualized Sharpe ratio in excess of 2, with a confidence level of 95%. Using their dataset, you are able to reproduce their result in an independent backtest. Why is this discovery likely to be false?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response**:\n",

    "The discovery is likely false because the reported results, while impressive, are presented without context. An annualised Sharpe ratio in excess of 2 with a 95% confidence level is exactly the kind of result that can be produced by chance when a researcher runs multiple tests on the same dataset. The paper likely suffers from selection bias because the authors only published the backtest that looked good, while hiding the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "López de Prado argues that without knowing the number of trials it took to produce this result, it is impossible to determine the strategy's true \"false discovery probabilities\". A backtest that is overfit to historical noise will not hold up on new data, and a high Sharpe ratio or confidence level is not a reliable indicator of success if it's the result of data mining. López de Prado notes that it typically takes about 20 iterations to discover a false investment strategy at the standard 5% significance level, making the undisclosed trial count crucial for proper assessment.\n",
